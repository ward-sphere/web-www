            Hello! I'm Mason, an '02 software engineer currently based out of Raleigh, NC.

            I fell into software because, like most people my age, I grew up online.
            
            After high school, I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science at NC State University where I gained interest in the domain of software architecture and design.

            I'm interested in software used for healthcare, finance, and deep-sea exploration.

            Outside of work you'll find me looking for the perfect Guinness pour.
